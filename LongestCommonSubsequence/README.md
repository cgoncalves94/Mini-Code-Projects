# Longest Common Subsequence Finder

## Description
This project provides a Python implementation for finding the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) of two strings. It uses dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently.

## Features
- Dynamic Programming: Utilizes a 2D list to store LCS lengths for sub-problems.
- String Comparison: Compares two strings character by character to find the LCS.

## Concepts Applied
- Dynamic Programming: Used for optimizing the LCS problem.
- Lists: 2D list used for storing LCS lengths for sub-problems.
- Loops: Iterates through the strings to fill the LCS lengths.
- Conditional Statements: Checks character matches and makes decisions accordingly.

## Sample Output
The script returns the length of the LCS for two given strings.
