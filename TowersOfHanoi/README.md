# Towers of Hanoi Mini-Project

## Description

This mini-project aims to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem using Python. The project leverages the concept of stacks to represent the towers and nodes to represent the disks. 

## Educational Objectives

The project serves as a practical exercise to understand:
1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
2. Data Structures (Stacks)
3. Algorithmic Problem-Solving

## How It Works

1. **Node Class**: Represents a disk. Each node has a value and can point to another node.
2. **Stack Class**: A data structure to hold the disks (nodes).
3. **Game Logic**: The `script.py` contains the game logic to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem. It initializes three stacks and moves the disks based on the game rules.

## To Run the Project

1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `script.py` to execute the Towers of Hanoi game.
