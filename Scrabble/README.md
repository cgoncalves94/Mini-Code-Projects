## Description
This project provides a Python implementation for calculating the point value of a word in the game of Scrabble. It leverages dictionaries and lists to map each letter to its corresponding point value, then sums these up for each word.

## Features
- Maps each letter to its corresponding point value.
- Calculates the total point value of a given word.
- Includes test cases to verify the functionality.

## Technologies Used
- Python

## Concepts Applied
- Lists and Dictionaries: Used for storing letters and their corresponding point values.
- Function Definitions: Defined a function to calculate word scores.
- Loops: Used to iterate through letters in a word.
- Dictionary Methods: Utilized the `.get()` method for safe dictionary lookups.

## Output
The script provides point values for test words like "BROWNIE" and "PYTHON".
