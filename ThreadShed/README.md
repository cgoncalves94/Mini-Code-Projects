## Educational Objectives

The exercise aims to teach the following programming skills:

- **Data Parsing**: Extract meaningful data from a raw string.
- **String Manipulation**: Use Python's string methods for data cleaning and preparation.
- **Data Aggregation**: Aggregate data to derive insights.
- **Date and Time Handling**: Work with date strings to filter or categorize data.
- **Data Storage**: Utilize Python's data structures like lists and dictionaries for storing parsed data.
- **Real-World Application**: Understand how these skills can be applied to solve practical problems in a business context.

## How It Works

The script processes a raw string containing sales data. It performs data cleaning, parsing, and aggregation to derive useful insights from the sales records.
