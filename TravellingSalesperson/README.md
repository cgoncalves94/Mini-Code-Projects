# Travelling Salesperson Solver

## Description
The Travelling Salesperson Solver is a Python application designed to tackle the classic optimization problem of the Travelling Salesperson. It uses graph algorithms to find an approximate solution to the problem.

## Features
- Dynamic Path Building: Generates a path that attempts to visit each city exactly once and return to the original city.
- Route Display: Outputs the selected route in a user-friendly format.
- Random Start Point: Chooses a random city as the starting point for the journey.

## Concepts Applied
- Graph Theory: Utilizes vertices and edges to represent cities and paths.
- Greedy Algorithms: Uses a greedy approach for path selection.
- Data Structures: Makes use of dictionaries to manage vertices and their corresponding edges.
- Complexity Management: Refactored to manage cognitive complexity and maintain clean code.

## Output
The program outputs a sequence of cities that represents an approximate solution to the Travelling Salesperson Problem. It also displays the path in a user-friendly format.
